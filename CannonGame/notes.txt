Responsiblities:

ConsoleIO

1.	Given the program requires an angle from the user
	When the console object write is called

	When the console object read is called
	Then it will return "5"

3.	Given the program requires a velocity from the user
	When the console object write is called
	Then it will print out "Please enter a velocity between 1 and 90"

4.	Given the user has entered an velocity of 5
	When the console object read is called
	Then it will return "5"

5.	Given the user has hit the target after 5 attempts
	When the console object write is called
	Then it will print out "Total Shots: 5"

InputValidator

1.	Given the user inputs an angle of 100
	When the input validator is called
	Then an exception is thrown

2.	Given the user inputs an angle of 1
	When the input validator is called
	Then no exception is thrown

3.	Given the user inputs an angle of 90
	When the input validator is called
	Then no exception is thrown

4.	Given the user inputs an angle of 0
	When the input validator is called
	Then a validation exception is thrown

5.	Given the user inputs an angle of -1
	When the input validator is called
	Then a validation exception is thrown

6.	Given the user inputs a velocity of -1
	When the input validator is called
	Then exception is thrown

7.	Given the user inputs a velocity of 1
	When the input validator is called
	Then no exception is thrown

8.	Given the user inputs a velocity of 20
	When the input validator is called
	Then no exception is thrown

9.	Given the user inputs a velocity of 21
	When the input validator is called
	Then exception is thrown

TargetGenerator

1.	Given the map has dimensions 10 x 10,
	When the GenerateTarget method is called
	Then a random x coordinate (1 <= x <= 10) is returned
	Ans a random y coordinate (1 <= y <= 10) is returned

TargetJudge

1.	Given x coordinate of target is 5
	And y coordinate of target is 5
	And x coordinate of shot is 5
	And y coordinate of shot is 5
	When JudgeShotHitsTarget method is called
	Then it returns true

2.	Given x coordinate of target is 7
	And y coordinate of target is 8
	And x coordinate of shot is 2
	And y coordinate of shot is 3
	When JudgeShotHitsTarget method is called
	Then it returns false

FinalShotCounter (ShotAttemptCounter)

1.	Given the counter value is 0
	When the increment method is called
	Then the counter value is increased to 1

2. Given the counter value is 1
