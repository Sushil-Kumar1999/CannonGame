Responsiblities:

ConsoleIO

Given the program requires an angle from the user
When the console object write is called
Then it will print out "Please enter an angle between 1 and 90"

Given the user has entered an angle of 5
When the console object read is called
Then it will return "5"

Given the program requires a velocity from the user
When the console object write is called
Then it will print out "Please enter a velocity between 1 and 90"

Given the user has entered an velocity of 5
When the console object read is called
Then it will return "5"

Given the user has hit the target after 5 attempts
When the console object write is called
Then  it will print out "Total Shots: 5"
